## Pixel Stories vs. Other Game Makers

Unlike other general game makers that demand a lot of coding to get started, Pixel Stories offers a straightforward game making workflow.

It’s made for 2D top down story-driven games, so it comes with all the necessary tools for that purpose. That includes an events system, dialogue editor, map editor, and default assets to help you get started. Additionally, you can easily import your own custom assets and customize different features of your game, so it has its own unique style rather than a cookie-cutter look.

We designed our game maker with accessibility in mind so that anyone can create their own game. Being web‑based, it only requires a modern browser, and its cross‑platform support ensure your game can be shared on desktop, mobile, or anywhere on the web!

Note for those coming from RPG Maker: We don’t have abritrary restrictions on game resolution, tile size or sprite animation formats! You also have full control over map editing layers. To avoid reliance on community plugins, we've tried to integrate all the essential features for making story-driven games directly into the game maker.
