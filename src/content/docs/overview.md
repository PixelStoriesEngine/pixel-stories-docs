Welcome to the **PS Maker documentation**. These guides are here to help you learn the editor, explore features, and build your own 2D top-down story-driven games.

Whether you are just getting started or looking up a specific feature, you can use this documentation as a reference whenever you feel stuck.

## What is PS Maker?

PS Maker is a no-code game maker designed for building 2D top-down story-driven games. If you are new to game development, it gives you approachable tools like the **map editor**, **event system**, and **dialog editor** to to tell immersive stories without needing to code.

If you are coming from another engine, you will find that PS Maker focuses specifically on storytelling features, so you can spend less time configuring and more time creating.

:::note[A message from Truman, the founder of Pixel Stories]
**The purpose of PS Maker** is not to become the ultimate tool for making story-driven games. Rather it is to lower the barrier to entry for those who are intrigued by the idea of making story games but shy away from the daunting technical barrier with various general purpose game engines, no-code engines, game makers... I want PS Maker to be someone’s first way to make games. I want them to fall in love with making story-driven games, learn the fundamentals of game design, and the skills needed to see a project through. PS Maker will always be limited in what it can do, I don’t want creators to be tied down to PS Maker. When they’re ready, I want them to take what they’ve learned and build even greater games with powerful general purpose engines.
