An **event group** is a collection of events that run one after another. They are put into the map and activated by the player interacting on it or touching it. They create interactive moments such as opening a door, talking to an NPC, picking up an item, or starting an NPC chase.

## Creating an Event Group

To create an event group, go to Events > Event Groups and make a new group. Add the events you want inside it, then place the group into your map so it can run during gameplay.

## Adding Event Groups to the Map

You can add an event group to the map by clicking "Add to Map" on the event group card. This creates the Add Event Group event automatically. Alternatively, you can do it manually by adding an Add Event Group event and selecting the group yourself.

### Trigger Types

Each event group can be set to trigger in different ways:

- **No trigger:** Runs automatically as soon as the group is added
- **On interact:** Runs when the player presses the interact key inside the trigger area
- **On touch:** Runs when the player collides with the trigger area

### Trigger Settings

You can customize how the trigger works:

- **Trigger size:** Adjust the area in pixels
- **Position:** Place it at a static point on the map or attach it to an NPC
- **Repeat or disappear:** Choose whether the group can be triggered multiple times or only once
