description: Use event groups in Pixel Stories to bundle actions together and trigger them on interact, touch, or automatically for flexible gameplay.

Event groups let you link multiple events into a sequence. They are reusable blocks that can be triggered when the player interacts, touches an area, or immediately when the group is added.

## What Is an Event Group

An **event group** is a collection of events that run one after another. Place them on the map to create interactive moments such as opening a door, talking to an NPC, or starting an NPC chase.

## Common Uses

- A note on a table the player can read many times
- A door that disappears after being opened
- NPC interactions that trigger dialog or chase sequences
- Puzzle triggers that run once when solved

## Adding Event Groups

Add an event group using the **Add Event Group** option. Once created, you can fill it with dialog, choices, player transfers, or any other events you need.

### Trigger Types

Each event group can be set to trigger in different ways:

- **No trigger:** Runs automatically as soon as the group is added
- **On interact:** Runs when the player presses the interact key inside the trigger area
- **On touch:** Runs when the player collides with the trigger area

### Trigger Settings

You can customize how the trigger works:

- **Trigger size:** Adjust the area in pixels
- **Position:** Place it at a static point on the map or attach it to an NPC
- **Repeat or disappear:** Choose whether the group can be triggered multiple times or only once
