title: "Conditional Branches"
description: Use conditional branches in Pixel Stories to change events based on player choices, variables, and inventory, creating dynamic stories with multiple outcomes.

Conditional branches let your events react to what the player has done. They check variables or inventory and decide which path to take, making your story interactive and flexible.

## What Is a Conditional Branch

A **conditional branch** is a check that runs during an event sequence. If the condition is true, the game plays one set of events. If false, it can play something else or do nothing.

## Common Uses

- Checking if the player has a key before opening a door
- Changing dialog if the player has already met an NPC
- Triggering different endings based on player choices
- Unlocking puzzles only if certain switches are active

## Adding a Conditional

Click **+ Conditional** in the event list. Add your condition, then place events inside each branch. Conditions are tested in order, so the first true condition runs its events.

## Supported Conditions

You can check for:

- **Switch variables:** True or false values
- **Number variables:** Greater, less, or equal to a number
- **Text variables:** Matches specific text
- **Inventory items:** Whether the player has or does not have an item

## Variables

Create variables in the **Assets** page. Variables cannot change type once created. Types include:

- **Switch:** On or off (true/false)
- **Number:** Any numeric value
- **Text:** A string of characters

Update values with the **Set Variable** event. Clear names like `hasKey` or `metNPC` help keep track as projects grow.

:::tip
Name variables clearly so you can find them later. Conditions run in sequence, so be careful that one branch does not accidentally make another branch below activate.

## Tips for Using Conditionals

- Keep variable names distinct and descriptive
- Remember conditions run in sequence, so one condition can affect the next
- Use conditions to build branching stories, puzzles, and multiple endings
