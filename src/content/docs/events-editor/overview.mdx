title: "Events Editor Overview"
description: Build story mechanics with Events in Pixel Stories. Add actions, set triggers, branch choices, and control maps and NPCs with a simple, sequential editor.

The **Events Editor** is where you turn ideas into gameplay. You add events, set their options, and the game plays them in order. Use it to create dialog, choices, map changes, puzzles, and more.

## What Is an Event

An **event** is a single action the game can perform. Examples include showing dialog, presenting choices, moving the player, spawning an NPC, or switching maps. You combine events to build complete moments in your story.

## What's Possible

- Dialog and choices for story scenes
- Doors or portals that transfer the player to other maps
- NPC movement, patrols, and chase sequences
- Puzzles using switches, numbers, and inventory checks

## Where Events Run

There are two places where events live and play:

- **Map Events:** Events that run when a map first loads
- **Event Groups:** Reusable sequences that run when triggered in the map

Map Events are great for intros or cutscenes. Event Groups handle interactions and touch areas that the player can activate during gameplay.

## Adding Events

Click **+ Events…** to open the event menu, then choose your event. After adding an event, configure its settings in the panel on the right. Events play from top to bottom unless a branch changes the flow.

## Event Groups and Triggers

An **event group** is a sequence of events that runs when a trigger fires. You can place a group in the map and choose how it activates:

- **No trigger:** Runs as soon as it is added
- **On interact:** Runs when the player presses the interact key inside the trigger area
- **On touch:** Runs when the player collides with the trigger area

You can set the trigger size and position in pixels. Triggers can be static at a location or attached to an NPC for talk prompts or chase mechanics. You can also decide if a group can repeat or if it should disappear after one use.

## Conditional Branches

Use **Conditional** to change what happens based on game state. Conditions can check switches, numbers, text values, or inventory items. This is how you build choices that matter and multiple endings.

- **Variables:** Create them in **Assets**
- Types: **Switch** (true or false), **Number**, **Text**
- Set values with the **Set Variable** event

Tip: Name variables clearly so you can find them later. Conditions run in sequence, so be careful that one branch does not accidentally make another branch true.
