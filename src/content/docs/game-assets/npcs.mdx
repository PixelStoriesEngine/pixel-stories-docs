NPCs are characters you define in the **Assets** page. They can be spawned into your game with the **Spawn NPC** event and controlled with animations and events.

## Steps to Add a New NPC

1. Open the **Assets** page and go to **NPCs**
2. Click **Create NPC**
3. Give the NPC a clear, descriptive name
4. Add the NPCâ€™s animations using sprite strips
5. Configure global animation settings, then adjust per-animation settings if needed

## Animations

NPCs support both idle and movement animations. Animations use **sprite strips**, which are frames laid out in a row. You can also set an idle animation to a single frame if you want an NPC with no animation.

Each NPC has **global animation settings** that apply to all of its animations, as well as per-animation settings for fine tuning. This saves time since most animations for a character share the same frame setup.

You can add more animations to an NPC and switch between them during gameplay using the **Set NPC Animation** event.

## Other Uses

NPCs are not only for characters. You can also use them creatively as interactive objects, such as items the player can pick up.

To control NPCs once they are in the game, see the [NPC Events](../event-system/npc-events) doc.
