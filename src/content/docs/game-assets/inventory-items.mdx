The inventory system lets you give players items that can be checked and used throughout your story. Items can represent keys, tools, or collectibles that unlock new interactions.

## Adding Inventory Items

To add a new inventory item:

1. Go to the **Inventory Items** page
2. Click **Create Item**
3. Enter a name, description, and an icon image if you have one

## Using Inventory in Events

Once items exist, you can add or remove them with the **Add Inventory Item** and **Remove Inventory Item** events. This updates the playerâ€™s inventory during gameplay.

## Conditionals With Inventory

Each item automatically creates a variable you can use in conditionals. This variable tells you whether the player currently has the item.

Example: a door can only be opened if the player has the **Key** item in their inventory.

This allows you to design mechanics like locked doors, quest items, and branching story outcomes.
