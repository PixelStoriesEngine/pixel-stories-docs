Player events control the player in your game world. There are four main player events: transfer player, set player location, add inventory item, and remove inventory item.

## Common Uses

- Doors and portals that lead to another room or scene
- Fast travel points between areas of a larger world
- Cutscenes that reposition the player before or after a sequence
- Puzzle resets that return the player to a safe location
- Spawn-in points after dialogue, choices, or NPC interactions
- Giving or taking away inventory items as part of quests or puzzles
