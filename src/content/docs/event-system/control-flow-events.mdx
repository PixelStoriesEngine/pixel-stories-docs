description: Use control flow events in PS Maker to manage sequences, run groups, set variables, and pause with timers for flexible storytelling.

Control Flow events let you manage how your event sequences play out. They help you reuse event groups, control timing, and store variables for branching logic.

## Common Uses

- Reusing sequences like a “show dialogue” group across multiple maps
- Turning off an interaction after it has been triggered once
- Updating switches or counters to track story state
- Adding dramatic pauses to dialogue or events with timers

Control Flow events are the backbone of branching, timing, and structure in your story. They give you the tools to move beyond linear event lists into reusable and dynamic gameplay.

## Control Flow Events

| Event                  | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Add Event Group**    | Runs another named event group, then returns to continue the current sequence.                                |
| **Remove Event Group** | Removes an event group so it cannot run again. Useful for removing an event at dynamically.                   |
| **Set Variable**       | Stores or updates a variable value. Variables can be switches, numbers, or text and are used in conditionals. |
| **Timer**              | Pauses the sequence for a set duration before continuing. Useful for pacing dialogue or cutscenes.            |
