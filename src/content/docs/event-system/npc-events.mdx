NPC events let you bring characters to life. You can spawn NPCs, set their animations, move them along paths, patrol areas, or chase the player and trigger follow-up events.

## Common Uses

- Introductions where an NPC walks in and speaks
- Guards that patrol a route and block doors
- Enemies that chase the player and trigger a failure or cutscene on contact
- Shopkeepers that stand in place with an idle animation
- Scene where multiple NPCs move and talk in order

## NPC Events

| Event                 | Description                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spawn NPC**         | Places a character in the current map. Useful for introducing characters or adding them dynamically during a scene.               |
| **Set NPC Animation** | Changes the current animation of an NPC, such as idle, walk, or a special state. Great for making scenes feel alive.              |
| **Move NPC**          | Moves a character along a defined path of points on the map. Best for one-time movements like walking across a room.              |
| **NPC Patrol**        | Loops a path continuously for roaming NPCs like guards. Runs until stopped or replaced by another event.                          |
| **NPC Chase**         | Makes an NPC pursue the player until contact, then runs a follow-up event sequence. Used for stealth, encounters, or fail states. |

## Paths and Editing

Paths are defined by points on the map. You can add, move, or delete points to adjust routes. Keep paths simple at first, then refine the timing and spacing to match the scene.
