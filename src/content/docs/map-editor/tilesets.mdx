Tilesets are the backbone of your maps. They provide the basic terrain: grass, dirt, water, walls, and other repeating pieces that form the world. By combining tilesets with autotiles, you can build environments that feel alive and consistent.

## What Is a Tileset

A **tileset** is an image that contains many smaller tiles. Each tile is like a puzzle piece. When you place them together, they form the ground, walls, or paths of your map. Right now, all tiles in Pixel Stories are locked at 16px. Support for different tile sizes are planned for a future release.

## Adding Tilesets

There are two main ways to add tilesets into your project:

1. Use the **Create Tileset button** to make a new one
2. Import from the **Asset Library**, which has open source assets already converted into Pixel Stories format

## Selecting and Placing Tiles

- Click on a tile to select it
- Drag to select multiple tiles at once
- Place them on your map with the toolbar tools

You can draw single tiles or larger shapes such as rectangles and circles. Erasing works the same way.

## Updating a Tileset

If you ever expand or edit your tileset image, you can simply replace the file in Pixel Stories. The map will keep working as long as you expand the image downward or to the right. This way, your old tiles keep their positions correctly.

âœ¨ **Tip:** Think of tilesets as the ground rules of your world. Once you set them up, you can build on top with objects and details to make your maps unique.
