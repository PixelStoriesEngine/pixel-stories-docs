Collisions control where the player can and cannot go in your world. Without them, the player could walk straight through walls, water, or any other obstacle. Collisions are invisible boundaries that keep gameplay believable.

## What Is a Collision

A **collision** is a defined area on the map that blocks the playerâ€™s movement. Tiles and autotiles do not have built-in collisions, so you add them manually. Objects can have their own collisions, but you decide whether or not to use them.

## Why Collisions Matter

Collisions:

- Prevent players from walking through walls, trees, or furniture
- Define paths, doorways, and restricted zones
- Add structure and challenge to your maps

## Adding Collisions

To add a collision:

1. Select the **Collision tool** in the editor
2. Place a collision box on the map
3. Drag the corners to resize it to fit the area you want to block

## Editing Collisions

- Move collisions by dragging them
- Resize them by pulling the corners
- Delete them when they are no longer needed

## Keeping Collisions Updated

If you change the terrain on your map, remember to adjust your collisions. For example, if you add a new path or remove a wall, update the collision boxes so the gameplay still makes sense.

âœ¨ **Tip:** Always test your map after adding collisions. Walk around as the player to make sure you cannot slip through walls or get stuck in the wrong place.
