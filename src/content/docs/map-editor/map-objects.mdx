Map objects bring personality and depth to your world. They are everything that sits on top of the terrain: trees, houses, furniture, signs, and even animated sprites. Objects make your maps feel alive.

## What Is a Map Object

A **map object** is a sprite that you place onto your map. Unlike tiles, objects are not locked to the grid size and can be any dimensions you want. They also handle depth automatically, so you do not need to mess around with layers.

## Why Use Objects

Objects give you more flexibility than tiles:

- **Automatic depth sorting:** The editor figures out whether the player should be in front of or behind an object
- **Free dimensions:** Objects can be any size, even something unusual like 11 × 8 pixels
- **Better organization:** Large maps with lots of detail are easier to manage when objects are separate from tiles

Note: Map objects are static in the map and cannot be controlled by events. If you are looking for a dynamic and controllable object, use an NPC instead!

## Adding Objects

You can add objects in two ways:

1. Create them directly in the **Objects tab** of the editor
2. Import from the **Asset Library**, which includes open source objects ready for Pixel Stories

## Animated Objects

Objects can also be animated. Use a sprite strip (a series of frames in one image) and tell the editor the frame width, height, and frame rate. Pixel Stories will loop the animation automatically.

## Organizing Objects

- Assign categories to objects so your asset library stays clean
- Use categories like “Trees,” “Furniture,” or “Buildings” for easier navigation in large projects

## Depth Origin

The **depth origin** sets the point of the object that counts as “on the ground.”

- 0 percent means the bottom of the sprite
- 100 percent means the top
- Usually, 0 works fine, but you can adjust it for tall objects

## Object Collisions

By default, objects do not block the player. You can add collisions by clicking **Set Collision** and resizing the red rectangle to match the solid area.

## Using the Toolbar

Once you have objects ready, use the top toolbar to:

- Place objects into the map
- Move them around
- Erase them when needed

✨ **Tip:** Use objects for anything that should feel unique. Tiles are for repeating patterns, but objects are for details that stand out.
