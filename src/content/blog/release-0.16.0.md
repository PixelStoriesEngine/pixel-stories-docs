## New NPC Chase Player and Patrol Events

Pixel Stories 0.16.0 focuses on making NPCs far more interactive. You can now set characters to actively pursue the player or patrol along a path. Event groups can also follow an NPC so any events you attach will trigger when that character is touched or interacted with.

These additions open the door to exciting stealth sequences, chases, and dynamic encounters that react to the player's movements. Combined with various fixes across the editor and events system, this update should make your stories feel more alive and immersive.
