## Welcome to the Pixel Stories Blog!

We're excited to have you here as part of the Pixel Stories community! Pixel Stories is still in development, but we've created this blog to keep you updated on everything happening behind the scenes.

Here, we’ll share the latest news, updates, and announcements about the engine, so you can stay in the loop.

Our goal with Pixel Stories is to create a user-friendly engine for crafting story-driven games, and we’ll be sharing our journey and progress with you along the way. Stay tuned for new features, insights, and sneak peeks as we build Pixel Stories together!
