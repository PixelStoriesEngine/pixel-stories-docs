Today I'm adding a blog to Pixel Stories! The purpose of this blog is to keep our community updated on the latest developments as we build the game maker.

### Why Have a Blog?

Pixel Stories started as passion project which has now evolved into a game maker built for story-driven games. I've been working on it for the past year and a half, continuously improving the game maker and adding features. About a week ago, I realized that there was no way for someone to see how the game maker has progressed since it's conception.

That's why I added this blog to the website. I plan to use this blog as a medium to share exciting new
features as well as showcasing work in progress and keeping a change log.

Thank you for the overwhelming support thus far for Pixel Stories! I'm looking forward to what the future holds.
