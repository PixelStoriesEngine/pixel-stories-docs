## Introducing Inventory System

The 0.15.0 release brings a brand new inventory system. You can now create custom items and display them in a sleek inventory bar with a slide-out panel showing each item's details. New events let you add or remove items while playing, opening the door to fetch quests and other exploration mechanics.

Each item also exposes a variable you can check in conditional events. This means you can branch your story depending on whether or not the player has a particular item. Combined with the new UI, the system supports dynamic puzzles and interactions that react to your player's choices.
