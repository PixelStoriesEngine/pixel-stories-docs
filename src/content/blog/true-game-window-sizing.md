# True Game Window Sizing!

Our latest update brings a better approach to game scaling that makes more sense. We’ve removing redundant game size settings and introduced “true game size,” where every game pixel directly corresponds to a screen pixel. In addition, a new zoom setting is added for pixel art since pixel sizes are super small. You can now also choose between fitting or filling the game window for improved responsiveness.
