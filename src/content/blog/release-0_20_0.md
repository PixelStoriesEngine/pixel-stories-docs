Pixel Stories 0.20.0 focuses on smoothing out the first moments in the editor and giving storytellers richer tools for motion and atmosphere.

## Learn the editor faster

New projects now open with an onboarding tour that walks through the Pixel Stories Maker interface. The tour highlights the most important panels so first-time builders can find maps, events, and assets without bouncing between menus.

We also tidied up terminology across the editorâ€”dialog boxes now consistently use the "dialogue" spelling to better match narrative content.

## Animate characters with confidence

Animation events received a round of updates. The returning Fade Transition event helps stage map changes or cutscenes, while the Play Character Animation event fires one-off sequences for dramatic moments. Movement animation sets are now easier to manage too: the renamed **Set Character Movement Animations** event lets you define walk cycles for both NPCs and the player in one place.

## Stage moodier scenes with camera effects

You can now apply camera-wide effects directly from the event system. The new Set Camera Effect event supports filters like the horror vignette, letting you quickly change the look and feel of a scene while keeping UI elements crisp.
