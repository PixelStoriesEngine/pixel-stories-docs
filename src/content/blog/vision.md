## What are we building?

We are building a platform that lets anybody play and create interactive story-driven RPGs.

Great stories can be told through 2D role-playing games. There are many examples of this,
including [Undertale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/), [Lisa](https://store.steampowered.com/app/335670/LISA_The_Painful/), and [Omori](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150690/OMORI/).

What makes these narratives distinct is their interactive nature, which fully immerses the player.

We want to give anyone the power to tell their story in an interactive medium.

To do this we are building a new tool that makes it easy to create story-driven RPGs.

## The story editor

Our platform consists of a story editor and a limitless catalog of community-made stories.

The story editor gives you powerful tools to edit the dialog sequences, characters, scenery, and multiple story paths.

The idea is that we will handle the logic, behaviors, graphics, and music, so that you can just focus on crafting a rich narrative.

Imagine the seamless building experience in [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) or [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com), but focused on interactive stories.

## What makes the stories fun?

Besides playing through rich narratives and building stories, these are some other fun features:

For story builders

- Build multiple story paths and endings
- Extend another person's story by branching it

For story players

- Play through rich and interactive narratives
- Choices can control the plot and influence the ending

## Join us

I'm really excited to share this platform with you and to curate a community of interactive story writers.

This project is still in development, but we will notify you once we release early access.

Join the waitlist and you'll be the first to try it out: [mypixelstories.com](https://www.mypixelstories.com/).

## Note on Default Assets

I want to faciliate creativity with unique games that have unique styles. But I also know that default assets are important for people without the artistic resources or just looking to test the engine. So if you choose to use default assets, they are seamless to replace with custom art once it’s ready.

## Let's Build It Together

The engine is free and you can jump right in at [https://pixelstories.io](https://pixelstories.io)

Let me know what you think! I hope the Pixel Stories Engine a breath of fresh air and a step in the right direction. (If it’s not, please let me know why as well!) You can find me by email at truman@pixelstories.io.

If you’d like to help drive the development, I am also active on Discord (https://discord.gg/XN9EaUh26g) where you can offer some suggestions, feedback, or just follow along the engine development journey. Thanks for checking it out!
