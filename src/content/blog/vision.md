I’m excited to introduce something I’ve been working on over the past year: Pixel Stories — a modern, no-code engine built specifically for story-rich games.

### What is Pixel Stories?

Pixel Stories is a web-based game engine that empowers creators to easily build immersive, story-driven games. Whether you’re an indie developer, writer, or artist, Pixel Stories lets you bring your story game ideas to life without the usual technical hurdles.

### Why Do We Need Another Game Engine?

Most existing no-code engines, like [RPG Maker](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com), are often too restrictive for creating unique, story-driven games. They tend to lock creators into specific styles or require challenging workarounds for customization.

Pixel Stories was built to offer more freedom and flexibility while staying easy to use and intuitive. It allows you to build top-down 2D story-driven games without the complexity of AAA game engines or the restrictiveness of outdated no-code engines.

We need a modern engine that’s intuitive, adaptable, and supports creativity — and that’s exactly what Pixel Stories delivers.

### Who is Pixel Stories For?

Pixel Stories is made for creating story-driven games. Whether you're an indie game developer, writer, artist, or narrative designer, this engine makes it straight forward to bring your story game idea to life.

The engine is designed to be easy to use, with a focus on building 2D top-down, story-driven games. If that's what you're interested in, then Pixel Stories will be the best way to create that type of game.

### Let’s Build It Together

The engine is free, and you can try it out now at [pixelstories.io](https://pixelstories.io). I’d love to hear your thoughts! You can also join the conversation on our [official Discord](https://discord.gg/XN9EaUh26g) to help shape the future of Pixel Stories.
