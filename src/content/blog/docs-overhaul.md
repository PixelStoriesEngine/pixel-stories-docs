# New Documentation Update

We’ve been working hard to make our documentation a place where you can quickly find what you need and get back to creating.

This update makes the docs more approachable for users looking to learn about how to use Pixel Stories and what's possible in the tool.

We added sections for the map editor, event system, and various game assets you should know about when building games with Pixel Stories. There's also a new [Beginner tutorial](/getting-started) that's up to date with the recent updates in the maker.

## What’s Next

We’ll keep expanding the docs with guides and adding new examples based on your feedback. If there’s a tutorial or explanation you’d love to see, let us know!
