Pixel Stories 0.18.0 gives both creators and players more ways to play their stories. Open the new in-game settings panel to see sound volume settings and controls, manage audio tracks directly inside PS Maker, and bring your adventures to mobile with touch-friendly controls.

### Game Settings Menu

Players can now open an in-story settings menu to tweak music and sound volumes on the fly. The panel also collects other presentation toggles, making it easy to customize how a story looks and sounds without interrupting the moment.

### Manage Audio in PS Maker

Audio joins the list of game components in PS Maker. Creators can upload, organize, and preview tracks alongside the rest of their project assets, keeping every sceneâ€™s soundtrack ready for playtesting.

### Touch Controls on Phones and Tablets

This release brings touch controls for mobile players. You can move your character and trigger interactions with the action button. Creators who are making stories will have them automatically be mobile ready.
