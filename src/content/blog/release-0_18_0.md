## Fine-tune every playthrough

Pixel Stories 0.18.0 gives both creators and players more ways to tailor their stories. Open the new in-game settings panel to balance music and sound effects, manage soundtracks directly inside PS Maker, and bring your adventures to mobile with touch-friendly controls.

### Adjust audio without leaving the story

Players can now open an in-story settings menu to tweak music and sound volumes on the fly. The panel also collects other presentation toggles, making it easy to customize how a story looks and sounds without interrupting the moment.

### Manage music and sound in PS Maker

Audio joins the list of game components in PS Maker. Creators can upload, organize, and preview tracks alongside the rest of their project assets, keeping every sceneâ€™s soundtrack ready for playtesting.

### Touch-first play on phones and tablets

This release brings a full touch control layout for mobile players. Swipe and tap to move your character, trigger actions with an on-screen button, and optionally surface keyboard hints so anyone can jump into the adventure.
