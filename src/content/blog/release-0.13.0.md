## Major Map Editor Overhaul

Overall, I would describe the focus of this update as a general UI/UX improvement to the map editor.

The major additions include support for multiple tilesets, support for undo redo in map editor, improved tools and map panning, and consolidating the active map while editing your story. The changelog for this update describes all the changes pretty well.

Unfortunately, I did have to do a breaking change in this update. If you had a tileset in your game, it will no longer be supported since we migrated to a system with multiple tilesets. The previous system was not great nor was it future proof, and supporting it would have increased the scope dramatics, delaying this update. Good thing we're still in beta!

Here is the old and new map editor screenshots. We focused on reducing the waste of space and making everything look nicer. When they're next to each other, you can really see the difference!
