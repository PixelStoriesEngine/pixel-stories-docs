# More Map Editor Enhancements

Previously, when zooming in the map editor, the grid would have a lot of weird behavior. Now, you can zoom in on the map smoothly! The grid adjusts correctly with zoom. We also added improvements to the map editing process. For instance, it’s easier to use map settings for grid visibility and snapping, as they’re now moved to a dropdown menu.

### Changelog

Added

- [Editor] Add default map zoom and map zoom features
- [Editor] Add map zoom input for precise zoom adjustment

Changed

- [Editor] Set default map editing tool to “pan”
- [Editor] Move map settings from a modal to a dropdown

Fixed

- [Editor] Fix map editor grid rendering bugs
