# New Free and Open Source Assets!

This update brings improved asset management by adding search and tags for better organization of terrains and map objects.

### New Tagging and Search

New tagging and search functionality makes it much easier to navigate and manage assets in the map editor. New assets from OpenGameArt, including the "Zelda-like assets" pack, have
been added, with more asset packs on the way!

### Better Organization

Previously, these assets were managed and edited directly in the map editor, which was not ideal. They have now been moved to the game assets section for a more logical workflow.
