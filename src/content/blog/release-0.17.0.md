## Streamlined Event Workflow and Map Editor Fixes

Pixel Stories 0.17.0 introduces a redesigned add event modal organized by event category, making it easier to find the event you need. Event groups and map events now live in separate tabs for a clearer workflow, and the show image event has been simplified to reduce clutter. Numerous map editor fixes and a new trigger area size option for event groups provide smoother editing and more flexibility when working with NPC interactions.
